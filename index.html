                    <h2>Jasper Eldrich Ballesteros</h2>
                    <p>I am Jasper Eldrich Ballesteros, I live in Banawa Sitio Lower Gunclub Brgy. Guadalupe Cebu City
                        
                        <br> I earned my degree from the University of Cebu - Main Campus and 
                        graduated with a Bachelor of Science in Information Technology.<br> 
                        I've been working as a penetration tester for about two years. 
                        As a penetration tester, I like to think of myself as analytical and meticulous, 
                        which is an important trait to have if you work in this industry. <br>
                        Working on simulated cyberattacks on a company's computer systems and networks is something I really enjoy doing. 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        In my free time, I love to do any form of arts such as tattoing and painting.
                        <br>I became tattoo enthusiast when i was 18 years old. And now I am 22 years old Im tattoing about 4 years.<br>
                        On my day off thats the only time i can do my passion.

            <p>I dedicated myself to tattooing, and many other things form of art. Even though for some people this is only a hobby, I find that creating art is good for me. Tattoing helped me better understand myself during my anxious and depressive periods. I often reflect on what went wrong, what I did wrong, and whether or not my actions were morally and ethically correct. It seems as though the tattoo machine gave me access to my inner self. The more strokes I make, the less anxious I feel.
                <br><br>I became a fan of art when I was six years old. When I entered college, I intended to major in fine arts, but the cost was prohibitive for me. Despite my lack of resources, I continued to pursue it as my favorite interest.    
                <br><br> Through art, I was able to connect with people in a community and be myself. Great artists are all around me, and I am humbled to see them on their shows. I don't feel insignificant, though; on the contrary, it motivated me to work harder and aim for excellence the next time I pick up a tattoo machine, Below is my sample works.<br><br>
